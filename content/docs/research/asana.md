Asana is a project management tool designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work. This guide provides an overview of how to set up and use Asana within our lab.

## Setting Up Your Asana Account

1. **Request Access**:
   - If you need access to Asana for your work but have not yet been added, contact our research manager or project research coordinator.

3. **Create Your Account**:
   - Upon approval, you will receive an invitation email from Asana. Follow the link in the email to create your account and set your password.

4. **Complete Onboarding**:
   - Once you are logged into Asana, complete the required training there.

## Selected Asana Terminology

- **Divisions**: Departments in a larger organization that function separately from the rest of the organization. We belong to the Biomedical Informatics Division.

- **Teams**: Subsets of people in a Division collaborating on projects.

- **Projects**: Groups of tasks. Projects can have an end date and be archived when completed, or they can be ongoing. 

- **Tasks**: Action items assigned to individuals with due dates. Tasks can be one-off items or set to recur. Tasks can also be dependent on other tasks, creating a workflow.

- **Subtasks**: Tasks broken down into smaller steps, each with their own due date and assigned team member. Subtasks include a space for instructions.

- **Comments**: Located at the bottom of each Task and Subtask, comments create a time-stamped record of questions, answers, and updates. Tag team members in comments using the @ symbol to notify them.

## Help and Training Resources
- **Training Session**: Training on how to use Asana, following departmental guidelines, will be provided by our research coordinator upon request. Please contact your Research Coordinator to arrange for training sessions.
- **Asana Help & Getting Started**: Access via the lower left corner of the Asana screen after logging in.
