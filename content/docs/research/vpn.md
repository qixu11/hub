To ensure the security of your data while working off-campus, it is essential to use the **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**. The VPN encrypts your data and provides secure access to the university's network.

## Installation
1. Select and Download the appropriate VPN Client from the [UF Health VPN page](https://ufhealth.org/vpn) for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Connecting to VPN
1. Open the VPN client.
2. To create a VPN connection, use the following settings:
   - **Name**: [gatorlink@ufl.edu]
   - **Server URL**: vpn.ufhealth.org
   - **Domain**: UFAD
3. Login your Gatorlink username and password.

## Best Practices
- Always connect to the VPN when accessing university resources from off-campus.
- Ensure your VPN client is up-to-date.
- Disconnect from the VPN when not in use to maintain network security.
