This guide provides an overview of the UF's high-performance cluster, [HiPerGator](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/get-started/hipergator/). HiPerGator includes cutting-edge processors and NVIDIA's Ampere A100 GPUs, making UF the first university globally to use this technology. Additionally, HiPerGator offers nodes optimized for memory-intensive tasks. Maintained by UFIT Research Computing, the cluster allows researchers to focus on their work without worrying about hardware or software maintenance.

## What is and Why Use an HPC?
A High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster is a collection of powerful servers managed by scheduling software like Slurm, which efficiently queues and runs user scripts. Here are some general reasons to use an HPC:

- **Enhanced Processing Power**: HPC clusters offer significantly more computational power than standard personal computers, enabling faster data processing and analysis.

- **Scalability**: HPC systems can handle large-scale computations and simulations, making them ideal for research that requires processing vast amounts of data.

- **Resource Efficiency**: By utilizing shared resources, HPC clusters allow multiple users to perform intensive computations simultaneously, optimizing resource usage and efficiency.
