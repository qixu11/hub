Dr. Liu is an Associate Professor with Tenure in the College of Medicine, Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics (HOBI) at the University of Florida. She also serves as the Director of Predictive Analytics and the Associate Director of Graduate Education in HOBI.

Dr. Liu earned her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kansas and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University. Her current research focuses on developing novel machine learning and AI techniques to enhance medical outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data. Her recent work includes predicting adverse drug reactions, diabetic kidney disease, acute kidney injury (AKI), and sepsis.

She is the Principal Investigator for significant projects funded by the NIDDK and NSF, which aim to identify personalized risk factors for AKI and develop secure, robust AKI prediction models through privacy-preserving federated learning across multiple healthcare sites.
